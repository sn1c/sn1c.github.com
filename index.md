Hey, my name is Sebastian and I am a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer based in Berlin, Germany.

I am currently working at Delivery Hero on delivery time prediction and ML infrastructure.

My interests within tech are machine learning, particularly supervised learning, NLP and MLops, engineering, including architecture and clean code, and open and responsible tech.

I plan to use this website to publish personal writings about these topics :)

You can get in touch with me via [contact@snickels.io](mailto:contact@snickels.io).
